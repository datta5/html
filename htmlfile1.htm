<h1>Understanding of html</h1>
<p1>
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <"!DOCTYPE html">.
The HTML document itself begins with <"html"> and ends with <"/html">.
The visible part of the HTML document is between <"body"> and <"/body">.
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.
HTML headings are defined with the <"h1">tags.
  HTML paragraphs are defined with the <"p"> tag.
  please ignore quotes on the tags.
